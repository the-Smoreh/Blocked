# Blocked

A game site. Vite + React 19, no backend, no router library. The whole thing
builds to static files.

Scaffolded 2026-09-10. Local git repo, no remote yet.

## Running it

The user is on Windows in PowerShell. **Use `npm.cmd`, not `npm`.** PowerShell's
execution policy blocks `npm.ps1` with an UnauthorizedAccess error. Do not tell
the user to change the execution policy, `npm.cmd` sidesteps it with no risk.

PowerShell 5.1 also has no `&&` operator. Chain with `;` or use separate
commands.

```
npm.cmd run dev      # port 5174
npm.cmd run build    # outputs to dist/
npm.cmd run lint     # oxlint
```

Port 5174 is deliberate. The user's other site, DeblockedX, uses 5173 and they
sometimes run both.

Node is a **portable** install at `C:\Users\cciec\nodejs`, not an MSI. If `node`
is missing from a shell, that shell started before the PATH change.

## How it is put together

```
public/games.json        all game data, the only file you edit to add games
src/lib.js               hash router, data loading, favorites, slugify
src/App.jsx              state, filtering, route switch
src/components/          Header, GameGrid, GameCard, GamePlayer
src/styles.css           one stylesheet, CSS variables at the top
```

**Hash routing** (`#/game/<slug>`), hand-rolled in `src/lib.js`, no
react-router. This keeps every URL a single static file request so the site
deploys to any host with no rewrite rules. Do not swap in a real router without
a reason, it would add a hosting requirement.

**Slugs** come from the title, so a game keeps its URL if the list is reordered.

**Categories** in the filter bar are derived from whatever `category` values
exist in the data. Adding a category needs no code change.

**Favorites** are localStorage, wrapped in try/catch because private windows and
blocked site data throw on access.

## Adding games

One object per game in `public/games.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "2048",
  "description": "Slide the tiles, match them.",
  "game_image_icon": "https://example.com/thumb.png",
  "category": "Puzzle",
  "tags": ["numbers"],
  "featured": false,
  "url": "https://example.com/game/"
}
```

This schema matches the user's DeblockedX library exactly, on purpose. That
library has about 450 curated entries at
`C:\Users\cciec\DeblockedX\games.json` and can be dropped in unchanged.

`game_image_icon` may be empty. The card falls back to the first letter of the
title.

## The real problem: link rot

Games load in an iframe, and hotlinked third-party games break constantly. Two
distinct failure modes, both seen already:

1. **Dead host.** `jakesgordon.github.io/javascript-racer` was a GitHub Pages
   site that no longer exists. Removed from the seed list.
2. **Refuses to be framed.** `gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048` redirects to
   `play2048.co`, which sets a `frame-ancestors` CSP. The iframe gives **no
   error event** when this happens, which is why `GamePlayer` shows a "New tab"
   hint after five seconds rather than trying to detect it.

The durable fix is **self-hosting** game files under `public/games/`. DeblockedX
already does this in its own `games/` folder. Prefer that over adding more
hotlinks.

### Verifying a game URL

Do **not** verify by screenshotting the player. The preview browser pane does
not render cross-origin iframes and logs no iframe network requests, so a
working game and a broken one both look blank.

Navigate a tab **directly** to the game URL and read the page text instead. Note
that a `fetch()` from the app origin returning "Failed to fetch" usually means
CORS, not a 404, so it proves nothing either way.

## Current state

Five seed games, all placeholders. Only their HTTP status was checked, **not**
whether they actually play. Treat the list as unverified.

Open decision the user has not answered yet: copy the 450 DeblockedX games,
self-host games instead, or curate a fresh list for Blocked.

Hosting is also undecided. Nothing in the code assumes a host, but if it ends up
on GitHub Pages under a subpath, `base` needs setting in `vite.config.js`.

## Writing style

User-facing text on this site must not read as AI-written. No em dashes, no en
dashes, no flowery product-copy descriptions. Short and plain. This is a
standing rule across all of this user's projects.

## About the user

Newer to web development. Explain the why, not just the command, and give one
command at a time rather than a chain. They are experienced with Minecraft
modding, so programming concepts land fine, the unfamiliar part is the web
toolchain and Windows shell friction.
